The sky is the area above Earth where the sun, moon, stars, and clouds appear. It's the upper atmosphere and the expanse of space that forms a vault over the Earth. In the daytime, it's often a blue expanse, while at night, it's filled with stars. The sky can be described as a "canvas" where colors and cloud shapes change.
